# Python Packages Report 2023-05-16

This report displays differences in the compliance automation execution Python
package environment since the previous execution.

<summary>More details...</summary>

Any **package version changes**
are largely informational.  They _can_ be used to debug why things worked
previously but aren't working today.  The compliance automation framework execution
environment depends on other of Python libraries.  These libraries can have new
releases and it's not outside the realm of possibility that a new release of a
dependency could cause a problem.  This report provides information that helps to
guard against that.  This report also checks whether the versions of the
[auditree-arboretum](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/auditree-arboretum),
the [auditree-framework](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/auditree-framework)
and the [auditree-harvest](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/auditree-harvest)
packages are the most recent versions available, as is the expected behavior.

Package version change warnings are informational but can be used in part
to debug why things worked previously but currently don't.  However, if the
`auditree-arboretum`, `auditree-framework`, or the `auditree-harvest` packages
are flagged as a **latest version violation** then that needs to be explained.
It is expected that the most recent versions of each of those packages are used
during fetcher, check and report execution.

## Python Package Deltas
These findings are largely informational.  They can be used to debug issues with
the execution environment.
